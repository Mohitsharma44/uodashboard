## uodashboard
UO Dashboard for allowing external agencies to view the images being captured in real-time

> Note:
> - The cam_name for metadata is obtained from the filename. Make sure it is consistent with image capture script.
The format is <img count>_<cam name>_<time since epoch>.
> - `cam name` is the last octet of the mac address (consistent with [`cuip`](https://github.com/Mohitsharma44/cuip))
